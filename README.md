Recommendation: You should create a python virtual environment and some package with pip,
We are using Pycharm jetbrains IDE, because is easy to create a viartual env and django projects, but you are free to use any IDE you like.

Basically we are using postgresql 9.6.3-2 as a database, you can set your own local database in settings.py, in the DATABASE [.....
....] section. In front-end, we're using materialize css v0.99.0, as back-end django 1.11.2. Check out requirements.txt for all packages needed.

Thanks for your contribution!
